                <p class="prs-text legal-terms-text">In consideration of the Service Provider agreeing to enter into Agreement with the Customer, Customer acknowledges, understands and agrees that:</p>
                <ol class="prs-text legal-terms-list">
                    <li><strong>Trading Non-Deliverable Bitcoin Settled Products are Very Speculative and Risky.</strong> Trading Non-Deliverable Bitcoin settled products are highly speculative and is suitable only for those Customers who (a) understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved, and (b) are financially able to assume losses significantly in excess of Margin or deposits.
                        <p>Trading with Non-deliverable Bitcoin settled products are not an appropriate investment for retirement funds. Customer represents, warrants and agrees that Customer understands these risks; that Customer is willing and able, financially and otherwise, to assume the risks of Trading with Non-Deliverable Bitcoin settled products and that loss of Customer’s entire Account Balance will not change Customer’s life style.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>High Leverage Can Lead To Quick Losses.</strong> The high leverage associated with trading with Non-Deliverable Bitcoin settled products can result in significant losses due to price changes. Customers must maintain the minimum margin requirements on their open positions at all times. It is the Customer’s responsibility to monitor his/her account balance. The Service Provider has the right to liquidate any or all open positions whenever the minimum margin requirement is not maintained. Increasing leverage increases risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prices, Margin And Valuations Are Set By The Service Provider And May Be Different From Prices Reported Elsewhere.</strong> The Service Provider will provide indicative prices to be used in trading, valuation of Customer positions and determination of Margin requirements. Although the Service Provider expects that these prices will be reasonably related to prices available in the open market, prices reported by the Service Provider may vary from prices available to banks and other participants in what is known as the open market. The Service Provider will exercise considerable discretion in setting and collecting Margin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Recommendations Are Informational, Customer Makes Independent Decisions, And The Service Provider Is Not An Adviser Or A Fiduciary To Customer.</strong> The market recommendations provided by the Service Provider do not constitute an offer to buy or sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy or sell, any contracts. Each decision by Customer to enter into a buy or sell order or other transaction with the Service Provider and each decision whether such order or other transaction is appropriate or proper for Customer is an independent decision by Customer. The Service Provider is not acting as an advisor or serving as a fiduciary to Customer. Customer agrees that the Service Provider has no fiduciary duty to Customer and no liability in connection with and is not responsible for any liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with Customer following the Service Provider trading recommendations or taking or not taking any action based upon any recommendation or information provided by the Service Provider.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommendations Are Based On Personal Judgments And Are Not Guaranteed.</strong> The market recommendations of the Service Provider are based solely on the judgment of the Service Provider personnel. These market recommendations may or may not be consistent with the market positions or intentions of the Service Provider, its affiliates and employees. The market recommendations of the Service Provider are based upon information believed to be reliable, but the Service Provider cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness thereof or represent that following such recommendations will reduce or eliminate the risk inherent in Trading with Non-deliverable Bitcoin settled products.</li>
                    <li><strong>There is no Central Market or Clearinghouse Guarantee.</strong> Each trade, order or position is a contract directly between the Service Provider and the Customer. There is no clearing house and no guarantee by any other party of the Service Provider payment obligations to the Customer.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Guarantees of Profit.</strong> There are no guarantees of profit or freedom from loss in Trading with Non-Deliverable Bitcoin settled products. Customer has received no such guarantees from the Service Provider or from any of its representatives. Customer is aware of the risks inherent in Trading with Non-deliverable Bitcoin settled products and is financially able to bear such risks and withstand any losses incurred.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer May Not Be Able To Close or Open Positions.</strong> Due to market conditions, Website maintenance, technical issues, system failure or other circumstances the Service Provider may be unable to close existing position or open new position at the level specified by Customer, and Customer agrees the Service Provider will bear no liability for failure to do so.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Interference and Third Party Attacks.</strong> There may be third party or other attacks targeting computers/networks, spreading malware, running botnets, (D)DOS attacks, defacing websites, violations of network security, etc. which can material alter, intercept or otherwise interfere with the giving or execution of an Order or the transfer of funds to and from the Customer’s Account. Customer acknowledges, understands and accepts that the Service Provider shall bear no responsibility or liability whatsoever for it.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem"><strong>Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Operator and Services Provider, its affiliates, contractors, licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any claims, actions, proceedings, investigations, demands, suits, costs, expenses and damages (including attorneys’ fees, fines or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to (i) your use of, or conduct in connection with, the Services, (ii) your breach or our enforcement of these Terms, or (iii) your violation of any applicable law, regulation, or rights of any third party during your use of the Service.
